#rshell

This project is a basic shell written in C++ and acts as a pseudo shell.

#Bugs:

* Connectors are not supported and will not function correctly
* There is no support for autofill when pressing TAB key
* Quotes are not supported and are instead ignored
* There is a Segmentation Fault when only spaces are inputted and followed by an ENTER key
* The UP arrow and DOWN arrow keys do no filter through previous commands
